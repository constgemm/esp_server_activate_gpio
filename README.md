This guide aims to retrofit a manual window shutter to an electric belt winder fully integrated in your smart home.
## Content:
I bought a standard add-on shutter winder, opend it up and added a couple of wires to the controler buttons. When short-circuiting those wires the butten is "pressed". These cables are then wired through a relay which is controlled using an ESP 12E over a webserver.
