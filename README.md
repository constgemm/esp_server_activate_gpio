This guide aims to retrofit a manual window shutter to an electric belt winder fully integrated in your smart home.
## Content:
I bought a standard add-on shutter winder, opend it up and added a couple of wires to the controler buttons. When short-circuiting those wires the butten is "pressed". These cables are then wired through a relay which is controlled using an ESP 12E over a webserver.  


## What you need:
* 1 Automatic Tape Winder for Manual Operated Roller Shutters 
* 1 ESP [exmple](https://www.instructables.com/id/Programming-ESP8266-ESP-12E-NodeMCU-Using-Arduino-/)
* 2 Arduion Relays [example](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-relay)

## TODO:
- [ ] include subscriber to Google Home
- [ ] add time window to set next up/down
